	<h1>Project Analysis</h1>

		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The current site for Orlando Tropical Transport lacks the polished image of a company that offers dependable and affordable transportation services.
		The intent of redesigning the site is to better communicate the company's commitment to quality service, gain market-share and increase the site visitor conversion rate. To reach the goals of this redesign, I aim to simplify the site layout, eliminate confusing and cluttered design elements, and unify the quote and reservations forms elements to improve the overall user experience. Focusing the site design for a more specific target audience will also help increase conversions.</p> 


		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
		<p>An analysis of Orlando Tropical Transport's competition revealed some useful information regarding the target audience, and aspects of service those businesses tend to focus on. The main key words these competitors consistently use are "transportation", "business", "customer service", "dependability", "safety", "on-time".</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.mearstransportation.com" target="_blank">www.mearstransportation.com</a></h3>
		<p>Mears Transportation Group serves central Florida, and is Orlando Tropical Transport's closest competitor. The web site is well organized and contains an introduction video emphasizing key words like "safety", "customer service" and "innovation". Mears positions itself as a hospitality-minded chauffeured services company that competes in the same market segments as Orlando Tropical Transport: shuttle, taxi, luxury vehicles and charter services.</p> 

		<p>An interesting side note: The designer for the <a href="http://orlandotropicaltransport.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Orlando Tropical Transport site</a> appears to have poached a <a href="http://mearstransportation.com/fleet/luxury-vans.htm" target="_blank">graphical element</a> from the Mears site.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.limos.com" target="_blank">www.limos.com</a></h3>
		<p>Limos.com uses the catch phrase "The Ride Revolution", and has a simple, user-centric site. According to data from Alexa.com, the target demographic for Limos.com are college educated women, between the ages of 45 to 54, needing business-related transportation. The Limos.com primary call to action is a well organized, yet simple form that allows visitors to submit a price inquiry based on specific needs. The results that are returned provide the visitor price quotes in a well-organized list. This would help minimize abandonment due to the ease of finding information on the services that Limos.com offers.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.supershuttle.com" target="_blank">www.supershuttle.com</a></h3>
		<p>A keyword search for "airport shuttle service" brought me to SuperShuttle's web site. The site is primarily focused on servicing customers traveling to and from an airport. Alexa.com's target audience data points to college educated men and women, ages 45-64 with business-related transportation needs as the site's main demographic. The SuperShuttle site has a clear Information Architecture/hierarchy, is well organized with emphasis on their 24/7 service catering to business travelers in major cities. The site "call to action" contains the catch-phrase "business-travel made easy".</p>


		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>Statistically, the target audience for Orlando Tropical Transport's market segment are mostly college educated men and women with business-related travel needs. Orlando Tropical Transport's proximity to popular vacation destinations may alter its target demographic slightly, but it is clear from my analysis that many companies in this market target business travelers between the ages of 45 to 54. These tend to be individuals needing to arrange transportation to or from an airport for themselves or a business colleague. Orlando Tropical Transport can gain market-share by emphasizing the companies business-friendly and reliable services, and utilizing a clean and professional-looking design for their website.</p>
